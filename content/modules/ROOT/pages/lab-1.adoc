= Section 1 Fundamentals, test automation, information related tasks

== Overview

In this section, you will learn about some of the different main approaches when automating against network devices.

At the end of this section, you will have learned about fundamentals, how to perform automated testing and using the information we can pull from the network to perform common tasks.


== 1.1: Different Ansible approaches to automating network devices
Ansible is versatile, meaning you can approach automating your network in many different ways. With that said there are some fundamental likeness  across different network vendors which we will deal with in this part of the workshop. Except for there being some general approaches which applies to your actual automation of network devices, the development approach is very much similiar, no matter what thing you use Ansible to automate.

* With that said, we would like to remind you of Ansible's three guiding development principles:

** Complexity kills productivity (keep it simple, it makes it robust, scalable and easy to maintain)
** Optimize for readability (makes for easier collaboration, maintenance and makes it more robust)
** Think declaratively (Ansible is a state engine, do not try to 'code' with playbooks, that you can do with modules)

=== 1.1.1: Vendor differences
When doing Ansible automation outside of the domain of networking, we are accustomed to use the same settings and the same modules, even when we automate against different operating systems. When it comes to networking, this is not always true.

* ☑️ Task 1: Review main differences between network vendors:

** How you connect to the devices. link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_index.html[Explore the list of options here].

** What modules you use to perform tasks like, fact gathering, configuration changes and command execution. link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/user_guide/platform_index.html#settings-by-platform[Explore the list of options here].

=== 1.1.2 Network test automation (using ContainerLab)
Writing Ansible automation may not feel like programming, but make no misstake, that is what you are doing. With that said, a fundamental of programming is testing your code.
The basics of testing your Ansible code includes static code analysis using standard Ansible tools such as ansible-lint, yamllint, ansible-test, flake8 and more.
You can read more about this on the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/testing.html[ansible.com dev-guide for testing] .

When Ansible testing becomes specific for networking, is when we are doing more proper integration tests - where we test to see if the Ansible automation actually does what it's supposed to do. In the world of normal operating systems, this is normally done by spinning up test VMs or containers and testing if your playbooks works against those. But in the world of networking, things are not as far ahead yet and it's not as common that people use virtualized or containerized test environments to test changes to their network elements.

With this said, allow us to introduce, link:https://containerlab.dev[containerlab], which is a tool which allows you to spin up container based working environments, using a CLI. link:https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/[Containerlab is also open source, distributed with a BSD license].

In order for you to be able to create an CI/CD pipeline, where newly created network automation is automatically tested and pushed to your environments, you will need to implement automated testing. Of course, in order to be 100% certain of what a change does, you may need an actual physical test environment to test switch or routing related configuration. But as that is still fairly rare, starting with a containerized test environment goes faster and requires little budget for upfront purcheses of equipment. Containerlab can run on a normal virtual machine, even a laptop.

image::ansible_network_testing.png[Overview of test workflow, 95%]

Quoting from the containerlab webpage, that more specifically states:
======
Containerlab focuses on the containerized Network Operating Systems,
which are typically used to test network features and designs, such as:

* Nokia SR Linux
* Arista cEOS
* Cisco XRd
* Azure SONiC
* Juniper cRPD
* Cumulus VX
* Keysight IXIA-C
* RARE/freeRtr

In addition to native containerized NOSes, containerlab can launch traditional virtual machine 
based routers using vrnetlab or boxen integration

☑️ Task 1: If you can. linkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdi7rwdJgkg[Click here, to have a look at this introductionary video on YouTube, for containerlab]

==== 1.1.2.1 Creating a containerlab test environment
In this section, you will learn how to create your first containerlab environment, which we will use to test against.
Containerlab uses a few main components:

* The containerlab cli tool
* The containerlab yml definition which decides how to build the network test environment
* A container engine, such as podman or docker.
* A Linux operating system to run it all on

DO NOT run below instructions. An example deployment is only shown below. When running the containerlab command to deploy a setup of network devices, you feed it a so called topology file, which containers how things should be setup. In our example, it's called containerlab-basic.yml. Command output includes the management IP addresses of the devices you have created.

[source,shell]

sudo containerlab --runtime podman deploy -t containerlab-basic.yml

Looking into the directory where we ran the containerlab command, that will create a lab directory, below called clab-containerlab-basic:
There is also a config directory where you put your switch configuration files.

[source,shell]
----
ls
----

.Command Output
[source,text]
----
clab-containerlab-basic config containerlab-basic.yml
----


In the lab relate directory, you will find an automatically generated ansible-inventory.yml file, a file with authorized SSH keys, a topology file, describing details about your deployment, including IP address of the management interface, mac-addresses, etc. And if you look deeper, there is a separate folder which is named the node names of the devices you deployed, below called "leaf1" and "leaf2" in the example below:

[source,shell]
----
ls clab-containerlab-basic/
----

.Command Output
[source,text]
----
ansible-inventory.yml  authorized_keys	leaf1  leaf2  topology-data.json
----

If we dive deeper into those device specific folders, we will find the devices flash storage there, with the files normal files we'd expected to find.
[source,shell]

NOTE: When you are asked to run commands, that is always done in your terminal.


☑️ Task 3: Create a simple containerlab definition, as follows:

* Two Arista switches which are connected to each other
* Save your work in the containerlab directory and name the file lab1.yml.
* To get an idea of the basic structure of your YAML based topology file, link:https://containerlab.dev/quickstart/[click here: https://containerlab.dev/quickstart/]
* Call your nodes leaf1 and leaf2
* kinds: should be ceos and image needs to be set to: localhost/ceos:4.32.0F
* The switches should be connected to each other: (leaf1:eth9 to leaf2:eth9 and leaf1:eth10 to leaf2:eth10).
* startup-config should be ~/advanced-networking-workshop/containerlab/configs/leaf1-start.cfg for leaf1
* startup-config should be ~/advanced-networking-workshop/containerlab/configs/leaf2-start.cfg for leaf2.

[NOTE]
====
As you can see, there are a few things we need to setup for us to use the devices for testing, namely:
* A configured management interface which we can connect to
* An initial user which we can connect with
* Means to authenticate our user (in this case, both a password and a SSH key is configured).

If you SSH to a device in your setup, you will authenticate automatically, that is because the SSH key has been added in your environment.
====


* ☑️ Task 5: Next, you are ready to start your lab environment. Use the "sudo containerlab" CLI command, in your terminal, accordingly:
* Use --runtime podman
* If you have already tried to deploy the lab once, add the --reconfigure parameter.
* Run "sudo containerlab --help" to get more information.
+
NOTE: we need to use sudo, because the workloads are very priviledged in nature.

Well done! You successfully executed most parts of what we would expected to see in an automated CI/CD pipeline, meaning:
* Runing a static code analysis on Ansible playbook
* Create of a test environment
* Runing playbook against test environment

TIP: If you like, you can re-deploy your environment and do the test over again.

```


The only thing we have not covered here, is how you would execute the tasks automatically in a CI/CD pipeline, the reason for that is that it would differ depending on what CI engines you run. With that said, most CI engines supports shell scripting, meaning you almost only have to add the commands you leared about here, to automate the process.

=== 1.1.3 Gathering information about your devices
Next thing which is something you often do when you automate against network elements, is gathering facts and information. Collecting information about devices are key to three main Ansible network use-cases:

* Performing backups
* Documenting the network
* Operational use-cases

And is also important when you add a little intelligence to your playbooks.

* What's special to facts gathering for network devices is that most vendors has their own facts gathering modules. For example:
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/ios_facts_module.html[Cisco IOS Facts gathering]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/arista/eos/eos_facts_module.html[Arista EOS Facts gathering]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/junipernetworks/junos/junos_facts_module.html[Juniper JunOS Facts gathering]

Let's dive into some of the basic use-cases and how we can implement them. First off, is using the command module.

==== 1.1.3.1 Using the command module
The command module allows you to inject any number of commands into a network device. This allows you to directly use existing knowledge about network device CLIs, in your Ansible automation. Different network vendors will have their own versions of the command module. For example:

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/ios_command_module.html#ansible-collections-cisco-ios-ios-command-module[Cisco IOS command]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/arista/eos/eos_command_module.html#ansible-collections-arista-eos-eos-command-module[Arista EOS command]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/junipernetworks/junos/junos_command_module.html#ansible-collections-junipernetworks-junos-junos-command-module[Juniper JunOS command]

Even if you can use this approach to make configuration changes, that is not recommended, if you do not have to. Overall, it is recommended and more common to use a config module or specific modules designated to do specific config change, there are good reasons for that, including:

* The command module is not idempotent, it will run a command, every time.
* Not using Ansible modules, you are directly implementing a specific version of the network CLI, prone to breakage in the future (what happens when a command changes?)
* Ansible is meant to be simple and declarative, using the command module is more complicated is less declarative.

So, you can see that the command module does violate several of the design principles for Ansible. 

With this said, a time when the command module often is very useful in your Ansible automation, is when you are looking to find specific information, eg. thing you would find when running various "show" related commands in your network CLI. Some examples:

* show int stat
* show cdp/lldp neighbor
* show arp int Xx0
* show ip route

* ☑️ Task 1: Create a playbook which displays a to you useful piece of information using the eos_command module and a show command. Print that information out to the screen using the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html[ansible.builtin.debug module]. Name the playbook show_info.yml and store it in the $LABDIR root directory.

End of solution: Task 2
```


TIP: Well done, later on in the workshop, you will learn some different methods where you can use this type of information to automate common tasks.

==== 1.1.3.2 Performing backups
A very common scenario when we are pulling information from the network devices is when we are performing backups. You can use the various facts gathering modules to perform a backup, but normally there is a config module you can use for this specific purpose, which is simpler to use. Again, like the fact gathering module, there are unique versions of the config modules for different network vendors. For example:

* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/ios_config_module.html[Cisco config module]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/arista/eos/eos_config_module.html[Arista config module]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/junipernetworks/junos/junos_config_module.html[Juniper config module]

Now it's time to do something.

* ☑️ Task 1: Read up on the Arista config module and create a playbook called arista_backup.yml as follows:
+
NOTE: Backups are made to /home/student/advanced-networking-workshop/backups
+
WARNING: You will need to use "become: yes" for this operation.

End of solution: Task 2
```


TIP: Well done, creating backups does not have to be more difficult. Of course, normally you would put them somewhere special, a location also backed up by some backup software.

==== 1.1.3.1 Documenting your network
Ansibles ability to pull information from your network devices allows you to automate something which not all organizations has - network documentation.

We will review a more basic example of creating network documentation, where we write information about our network devices to a plain text file. With that said, this information may as well be written to your CMDB system, using the ansible.builtin.uri module (or more specific one) to do a API call to some external system.

* ☑️ Task 1: Create a playbook called network_documentation.yml which uses the "arista.eos.eos_facts" module to gather facts from your switches, then use the copy module and jinja templating to save facts you care about, to the file network-documentation.txt. 

+
.An example of how to write information to a file using copy and jinja:
[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Write facts to disk using a template
      copy:
        content: |
          #jinja2: lstrip_blocks: True
          {% for host in groups['leafs'] %}
          Hostname: {{ hostvars[host].ansible_net_hostname }}
          {% endfor %}
        dest: ~/advanced-networking-workshop/network-documentation.txt
      run_once: yes
----

+
.An example of how to use the "ansible" command to review existing facts:
[source,yaml]
----
ansible -i inventory leafs -m arista.eos.eos_facts
----

==== 1.1.3.4: Adding intelligence to your playbooks
Now that you have learned about different methods to pull information from your network devices. Let's review how you can further use that information to make your playbooks smarter. Even though, we have learned that trying to do programming in playbooks violates basic design tenants of Ansible, we will now have a look at how close we can get, without ending up in an unmaintainable mess.

First off, let's review the different useful tools which helps us to process information gathered by facts and commands.

* ☑️ Task 1: Have a brief look at the different tools below and imagine how they may be useful.

Ansible modules:
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/assert_module.html[assert]
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/fail_module.html[fail]

The Ansible conditional:
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html[when]

Variable filenames:
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#selecting-variables-files-or-templates-based-on-facts[Selecting filenames based on facts]

Managing error handling:
* link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_error_handling.html[Error handling in playbooks]

Now, let's create some smarter versions of the playbooks we have previously create.


* ☑️ Task 2: Create a version of below playbook (eos_facts.yml) which only uses the eos_facts module when you have detected that it is an Arista switch.

+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: "Gather facts from Arista switches"
  hosts: leafs 
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Gather facts (eos)
      arista.eos.eos_facts:

      arista.eos.eos_facts:
      when: ansible_net_system == 'eos'
----

=====
======

```
End of solution: Task 2
```

* ☑️ Task 3: Next, add a eos_command task to previous playbook which runs "show version", save the output using register and then add an assert which validates that the output from "show version" DOES NOT include the content of the variable strange_thing, which you set to "Kernel version: 6.5.0-9-generic".

IMPORTANT: Because of the output we get from the "show version" command, we need to process the output and used search to find what we are looking for, like so:


.Below is true, if we DO NOT find it. Eg, list of hits less than 1.
[source,yaml]
----
ansible.builtin.assert:
  that:
    - "show_version.stdout_lines | select('search', strange_thing) | list | count < 1"

# To construct something which is true, IF we find it, use: count > 0. Eg, list of hits is more than 0.
----


Use a fail_msg and success_msg.

---

TIP: Try set the strange_thing variable to something else on the command line, adding this to your ansible-playbook command: -e "strange_thing=somethingelse" --limit "clab-lab1-leaf1"

TIP: Using this method, you can create a playbook which troubleshoots a device for different issues.

---

* ☑️ Task 5: Finally you are going to add variable file naming and the fail module to the eos_facts.yml playbook. Do this:
* Load a variable file, using ansible.builtin.include_vars in a task which runs after the eos_facts task.
* Use the {{ ansible_net_system }} fact (it will be set to "eos") in the name of your vars file.
* Set the following variable in your vars file: switch_sla: "premium"
* Use the fail module and a when statement to check if switch_sla was set to anything but "premium"
* Make up a suitable msg for the fail module.

IMPORTANT: Get some clues of how to do this by reading here: link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/include_vars_module.html#examples[include_vars module examples] and also here link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/fail_module.html#examples[fail module examples]

NOTE: Well done, now you know more about some of the useful features in Ansible which can make your playbooks smarter. This is something we will be using in the next section, where we deal with operational use-cases.

==== 1.1.3.5: Operational use-cases
Armed with knowledge about how we can pull information from devices and also how we can evaluate that information, it would not be strange if some of you already have considered how this can be used to automate some common operational use-cases.

A very common operational task which fits what we have learned like a glove, is troubleshooting.
Let's have a look at a practical example, which is helping to troubleshoot connectivity issues for a server to a leaf/access switch. The idea is that we get a playbook which will print out the ARP table for a given port.

☑️ Task 1: Create a playbook which use the arista.eos.eos_command module to display the ARP table on a specific port, also ensure that:
* Call the playbook arp_check.yml
* The name of the port we look at should be set using a variable called interface_name, allowing us to set it at runtime.
* Name the variable interface_name set it to be Ethernet9 by default.
* You print out the registered result using the debug module.

* ☑️ Task 3: Next, let's create a troubleshooting playbook which detects ports which are in a "notconnect" state. As follows:
* Name the playbook: check_port.yml
* Use the arista.eos.eos_command module and print out the result using debug.
* Use the ansible.builtin.assert module to assess that ports are not in a "notconnect" state.

NOTE: If you have time: If a port is in notconnect, gather further debug information about all ports.

1. Use: "show int stat" to find status of all ports.
2. Remember what you learned about assessing tricky output using assert? You'll need the same solution.
3. On the assert task, use: ignore_errors: yes. This is because we want it to assess all things and not stop when assertions are wrong.
4. If are you doing the :star: extra task: Use register on the assert task, then use a block which you tie to a: "when: port_assessment is failed"
